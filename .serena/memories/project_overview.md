# Project Overview
- Purpose: `siso-app-factory` is the deployable “code grocery store” for SISO—an npm workspace monorepo that bundles ~800 catalogued UI primitives, multi-domain feature packs (tour guides, bike rental, auth), planning frameworks, and AI tooling so external projects can import production components/features or clone the entire planning system.
- Structure: root docs (STATUS, ROADMAP, AI-USAGE-GUIDE), `packages/` (ui, tour-guides, bike-rental, auth-system), `frameworks/` (multi-tenant etc.), `project-setup-system/` (9-phase planning + prompts, templates, integrations), `tools/` (core: metadata/search/import; observability: LangFuse scripts; legacy helper), plus status/test artifacts.
- Tech stack: TypeScript/React component packages with strict tsconfig, metadata JSON per component/feature, Node/npm workspaces, optional Supabase/Next auth kit, scripts in `.cjs` modules, LangFuse observability, planning content for AI-led multi-phase workflows.
- Key assets: docs enumerating progress, AI usage instructions, project setup system (MASTER-SETUP-PROMPT, validations, knowledge bases), LangFuse tracking scripts, component metadata catalog (`docs/ai-catalog.json`), frameworks for multi-tenant deployments.
