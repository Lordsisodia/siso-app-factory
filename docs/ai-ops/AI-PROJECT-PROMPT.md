How to use:

**Step 1: Load the Catalog**

The factory has an AI-searchable catalog at `docs/catalog/components-and-features.json`.

Read this file to see ALL available components and features with metadata:
- Visual styles, use cases, complexity
- What each feature includes
- Industry fit scores
- Usage examples

**Step 2: Search for What I Need**

Use natural language to search:
- "I need a premium button for a hero section"
- "I need a carousel for product displays"
- "I need a complete booking system with deposits"
- "I need authentication with protected routes"

The AI search tool can help you find the best matches from 650+ options.

**Step 3: Import and Use**

Components can be imported as:
```tsx
import { Button } from '@siso/ui/primitives/buttons/magic-ui-rainbow-button'
import { BookingSystem } from '@siso/tour-guides/features/booking-system'
import { dateUtils } from '@siso/bike-rental/shared/utils'
```

Or copy the component files directly into my project.

**Step 4: Apply Multi-Tenant Framework (if needed)**

If building a multi-client system, follow:
`frameworks/multi-tenant-architecture/guides/NEW-CLIENT-SETUP.md`
