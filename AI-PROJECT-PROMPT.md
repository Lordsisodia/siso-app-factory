## üìã PROMPT FOR AI

```
I'm working on a new project and need to use the SISO App Factory - our centralized code library.

Repository: https://github.com/Lordsisodia/siso-app-factory

Please help me:

1. Clone or reference the SISO App Factory repository
2. Understand what components/features are available
3. Search for the components I need
4. Integrate them into my project

---

- 633 Primitives (buttons, cards, modals, forms, tables, inputs, etc.)
- 146 Patterns (layouts, sections, animations, backgrounds, etc.)
- Organized in 52 categories for easy discovery

**19 Complete Features:**
- 12 Tour Guide features (booking, admin, payments, notifications, media, QR, weather, analytics, reviews, blog, users, availability)
- 7 Bike Rental features (booking, catalog, reviews, dashboard, admin, filters, auth)

How to use:

**Step 1: Load the Catalog**

The factory has an AI-searchable catalog at `docs/ai-catalog.json`.

Read this file to see ALL available components and features with metadata:
- Visual styles, use cases, complexity
- What each feature includes
- Industry fit scores
- Usage examples

**Step 2: Search for What I Need**

Use natural language to search:
- "I need a premium button for a hero section"
- "I need a carousel for product displays"
- "I need a complete booking system with deposits"
- "I need authentication with protected routes"

The AI search tool can help you find the best matches from 650+ options.

**Step 3: Import and Use**

Components can be imported as:
```tsx
import { Button } from '@siso/ui/primitives/buttons/magic-ui-rainbow-button'
import { BookingSystem } from '@siso/tour-guides/features/booking-system'
import { dateUtils } from '@siso/bike-rental/shared/utils'
```

Or copy the component files directly into my project.

**Step 4: Apply Multi-Tenant Framework (if needed)**

If building a multi-client system, follow:
`frameworks/multi-tenant-architecture/guides/NEW-CLIENT-SETUP.md`
