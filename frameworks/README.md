# SISO App Factory - Frameworks

**Purpose:** Reusable frameworks and architectures for building scalable applications

---

## üìö Available Frameworks

### **1. Multi-Tenant Architecture** ‚≠ê

**Purpose:** Build ONE codebase that serves multiple clients from ONE Supabase database

**What's Included:**
- Multi-tenant database schema with client_id isolation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Configuration-driven theming system
- Fork and deploy process (new client in 10 minutes)
- Environment variable templates
- Step-by-step setup guides

**Use Cases:**
- Restaurant chains (multiple locations, one system)
- Tour operators (multiple brands, one platform)
- Rental companies (bikes, cars, equipment across regions)
- SaaS products (multiple customers, one app)
- Any multi-client business

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ One codebase, infinite clients
- ‚úÖ One database (cost-effective)
- ‚úÖ Config-driven branding (colors, fonts, logo)
- ‚úÖ Fast client onboarding (10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Centralized management
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes benefit all clients

**Documentation:**
- [README.md](./multi-tenant-architecture/README.md) - Overview
- [database/MULTI-TENANT-SCHEMA.md](./multi-tenant-architecture/database/MULTI-TENANT-SCHEMA.md) - Database design
- [theming/CONFIG-DRIVEN-THEMING.md](./multi-tenant-architecture/theming/CONFIG-DRIVEN-THEMING.md) - Theming system
- [deployment/FORK-AND-DEPLOY.md](./multi-tenant-architecture/deployment/FORK-AND-DEPLOY.md) - Deployment process
- [guides/NEW-CLIENT-SETUP.md](./multi-tenant-architecture/guides/NEW-CLIENT-SETUP.md) - Quick start

## üöÄ Quick Reference

### **Multi-Tenant Checklist:**

**Database:**
- [ ] Add `client_id UUID` to all tables
- [ ] Create indexes on `client_id`
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] Create RLS policies
- [ ] Create `clients` configuration table

**Application:**
- [ ] Identify client from subdomain/domain
- [ ] Set client context in middleware
- [ ] Filter all queries by `client_id`
- [ ] Load theme from `clients` table
- [ ] Generate CSS variables from theme

**Deployment:**
- [ ] Fork template per client
- [ ] Set CLIENT_ID environment variable
- [ ] Set theme colors/logo
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Configure custom domain

**Verification:**
- [ ] Data isolation working (RLS prevents cross-client access)
- [ ] Theme applied correctly
- [ ] Features enabled per client config
- [ ] Custom domain resolves
- [ ] Site performant and functional
