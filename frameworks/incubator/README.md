# Framework Incubator

Drafts and experiments live here until they are production-ready. Each concept should include:
- `STATUS.md` with owner, status, and exit criteria.
- At least one explainer (e.g., architecture.md) describing the idea.

Move items into the main `frameworks/` catalog once they adopt the numbered layout and have been reviewed.
