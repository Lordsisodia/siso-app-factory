# SISO Platform Ring

Centralized packages that every template and experience consumes.

## Modules

- `ui/` – published as `@siso/ui`; exposes primitives, patterns, utils.
- `auth-system/` – published as `@siso/auth-system`; ships Supabase hooks, middleware, migrations.
- (Planned) `data/`, `analytics/`, `observability/` folders for shared SDKs.

> Legacy docs may still point to `packages/ui` – they now refer to `packages/platform/ui`.
