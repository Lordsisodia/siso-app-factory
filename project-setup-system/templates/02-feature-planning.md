## Prioritization Framework

### Scoring Criteria
- **Impact** (1-5): User value and business impact
- **Confidence** (1-5): How well we understand requirements
- **Effort** (1-5): Development complexity (1=easy, 5=hard)

### ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence) / Effort

| Feature | Impact | Confidence | Effort | ICE Score | Priority |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|-----------|----------|
|         | 5      | 4          | 2      | 10.0      | High     |
|         | 4      | 3          | 4      | 3.0       | Medium   |
|         | 3      | 2          | 5      | 1.2       | Low      |
