# Example Reference Implementations

This folder contains reference implementations showing how the SISO App Factory planning system produces real results.

## Restaurant Project Example

The **Restaurant Platform** in the parent directory serves as the complete reference implementation.

### Key Planning Artifacts to Study

**Research Phase**:
- `../../docs/01-research/research-summary.md` - Market research example
- Shows how to document industry data with sources

**Feature Planning**:
- `../../docs/03-features/features.md` - 100+ features documented
- `../../docs/03-features/feature-matrix.md` - Competitor comparison
- Evidence-based prioritization with data

**Architecture**:
- `../../docs/05-technical/architecture.md` - Domain-driven design
- Multi-tenant strategy
- Complete tech stack decisions

**Database Design**:
- `../../docs/05-technical/schema-spec.md` - Full schema
- `../../docs/05-technical/erd.md` - Entity relationships

**Build Plan**:
- `../../docs/08-build-plan/master-checklist.md` - 7 phases, 100+ tasks
- `../../docs/08-build-plan/domains/*.md` - Per-domain checklists
- Complete timeline and dependencies

**PDR**:
- `../../docs/06-pdr/PDR.md` - Comprehensive requirements doc
- Vision, scope, architecture, operations

**BMAD Integration**:
- `../../docs/00-methods/bmad/` - BMAD methodology usage
- Domain operations mapping
- Workflow documentation

## What You'll Learn

1. **Quality Standards**: See what "complete" looks like
2. **Documentation Depth**: Balance between detail and clarity
3. **Structure**: How to organize planning artifacts
4. **Evidence**: How to cite sources and justify decisions
5. **Completeness**: All phases executed systematically

## Using These Examples

### For Your First Project
1. Read through restaurant planning docs
2. Understand the thought process
3. Apply same rigor to your industry
4. Customize templates for your context

### For AI Agents
Reference these when:
- Unsure about documentation depth
- Need format examples
- Want to verify completeness
- Looking for evidence quality benchmarks

## Stats from Restaurant Example

- **Planning Days**: 10 days
- **Total Documentation**: 50+ pages
- **Features Documented**: 100+
- **Competitors Analyzed**: 15
- **Domains Defined**: 18
- **Database Tables**: 30+
- **Build Tasks**: 100+
- **Implementation Timeline**: 12 weeks

This level of planning enables confident execution and reduces costly rework.
