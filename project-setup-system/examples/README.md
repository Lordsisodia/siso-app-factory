# Example Reference Implementations

The canonical reference project is documented in the main `README.md` under **“Learn from Examples.”** Use that section for the latest links to the restaurant planning artifacts (and any future industry samples). Keeping everything linked from the README avoids having to maintain duplicate descriptions in multiple places.

Quick pointers:
- Restaurant planning deliverables live in `client-projects/Restraunt/docs/`.
- Follow the checklist in `PRD-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` to judge completeness.
- When new industry examples ship, add them to the README table so both humans and AIs discover them from a single index.
