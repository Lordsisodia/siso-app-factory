# Deep Research Brief: AI Coder Execution & Orchestration Strategies

**Research Date**: October 21, 2025
**Purpose**: Understand how to optimize planning documentation so AI coders (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can successfully execute full-stack app builds
**Context**: SISO App Factory Universal PRD Framework

---

## 📋 Research Context

### What We're Building

**SISO App Factory** is a Universal AI PRD Framework that:

1. **Planning Phase** (Phases 1-9): AI agents create comprehensive planning docs
   - Market research, competitor analysis
   - Feature planning and prioritization
   - Architecture design and component mapping
   - Database schema specification
   - Detailed build plan with 100+ tasks

2. **Implementation Phase** (AI Coders Execute): External AI coding tools read those docs and build the app
   - Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Replit Agent, etc.
   - They scaffold Next.js 15 app
   - Copy/assemble components from our 1,983+ component library
   - Generate domain code
   - Create database migrations
   - Configure integrations (Supabase, Clerk, Stripe)
   - Test and validate

### What We Have

**Component Library**:
- 1,983+ production-ready React components
- Organized in `siso-app-factory/packages/platform/ui/src/`
- 50+ primitive categories (buttons, cards, forms, heroes, etc.)
- Pattern components (sections, lists, layouts)
- Domain packages (restaurants, bike-rental, tour-guides)
- AI catalog system (`docs/catalog/components-and-features.json` with metadata)
- AI search tool (`tools/core/ai-search.cjs` for natural language component discovery)

**Planning Documentation** (What AI Coders Will Read):
- `docs/08-build-plan/master-checklist.md` - 7 phases, 100+ tasks
- `docs/05-technical/component-catalog.md` - Which components to use
- `docs/05-technical/architecture.md` - System design
- `docs/05-technical/schema-spec.md` - Database tables
- `docs/05-technical/erd.md` - Entity relationships
- `siso-site-config.yaml` - Theme configuration
- `docs/00-methods/bmad/domain-flows/*.md` - Domain operations

**Multi-Tenant Framework**:
- Config-driven theming (YAML → Database → CSS variables)
- RLS policies for data isolation
- Fork-and-deploy model (one codebase, infinite clients)

**Tech Stack Defaults**:
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Clerk (Authentication)
- Vercel (Deployment)

### The Key Principle

**We're NOT building a code generator** - We're building planning docs that ANY AI coder can execute.

**AI-Coder Agnostic**:
- Use Codex CLI today
- Use Claude Code tomorrow
- Use GPT-6 next year
- As AI coders improve, our system automatically benefits

**This is our scalability moat** - future-proof planning system, not a brittle code generator.

```
- [ ] Set up Clerk authentication
```

**Format B (Detailed)**:
```
- [ ] Set up Clerk authentication
  - Install @clerk/nextjs
  - Create middleware.ts with auth check
  - Add ClerkProvider to layout
  - Create sign-in page at /sign-in
  - Configure JWT template for Supabase integration
```

**Format C (With Examples)**:
```
- [ ] Set up Clerk authentication
  - Follow: docs/integrations/CLERK-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md
  - Use components from: packages/platform/ui/src/primitives/sign-ins/
  - Reference: https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs
  - Expected outcome: Users can sign in/out, session persists
```

**Which format yields highest success rate?**

#### Q20: Component Mapping Specification
- How should we specify component usage in build plan?
- Just names? Full paths? Code examples?
- How to communicate component props/configuration?

**Example Formats**:

```

**Format B (Path)**:
```
Hero Section: Copy from packages/platform/ui/src/primitives/heroes/HeroFullscreen.v2
```

**Format C (With Props)**:
```
Hero Section:
  Component: packages/platform/ui/src/primitives/heroes/HeroFullscreen.v2
  Props:
    title: "Welcome to [Restaurant Name]"
    subtitle: "Authentic [Cuisine] Dining"
    image: "from config"
    cta: "View Menu"
```

**Which format makes AI coders most successful?**

- How detailed should database schema specs be for AI coders?
- SQL code directly? Or descriptions AI converts to SQL?
- How to specify RLS policies?
- How to communicate indexes, constraints, relationships?

**Example Levels**:

**Level 1 (High-Level)**:
```
Table: menu_items
- name (string)
- price (decimal)
- restaurant_id (foreign key)
```

**Level 2 (Detailed)**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE menu_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  restaurant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES restaurants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (price >= 0),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_menu_items_restaurant ON menu_items(restaurant_id);

-- RLS Policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON menu_items
  FOR ALL USING (restaurant_id = auth.uid());
```

**Which level do AI coders execute more successfully?**
