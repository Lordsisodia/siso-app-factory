**Questions Answered**: 5 Priority Questions (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4-Q7, Q8-Q10)
**Purpose**: Optimize SISO App Factory planning docs for AI coder execution success

---

## Q1. Task Format: Brief vs Detailed Prompts (Reference-Rich vs Concise)

### Summary

The level of detail in task prompts significantly influences AI coding success. Overly long prompts can confuse models, while concise, clear instructions tend to yield more accurate code. Including relevant references (code snippets, examples) can improve results, but only if they directly support the task at hand.

### Key Findings

1. **Brevity Benefits**: Studies show that smaller prompts generally have higher success rates, whereas very long prompts often introduce errors. Prompts under ~50 words performed better on coding tasks, while overly detailed prompts sometimes led to irrelevant or "garbage" code.

2. **Clarity Over Volume**: The key is providing clear, unambiguous requirements. Vague prompts yield vague (often incorrect) results. In one guide, adding specific details (language, algorithm, constraints) to a prompt reduced back-and-forth refinements by 68%, meaning the AI got it right the first time more often.

3. **Reference-Rich Context**: Including examples or existing code in the prompt can guide the AI. For instance, providing a function signature and an example of expected output acts as an implicit constraint, steering the model toward the desired format. However, irrelevant or excessive reference material can distract the model and degrade output quality.

4. **Avoid Overload**: Developers report that dumping entire documents or too many files "just in case" tends to confuse the LLM and increase token usage without benefit. It's better to supply only the most pertinent information and requirements.

### Real-World Examples

**Graphite's AI Prompt Guide**:
- **Weak Prompt**: "Write a sorting algorithm"
- **Strong Prompt**: "Write a merge sort algorithm in Python that sorts a list of integers. Optimize for memory efficiency. Handle edge case of empty list."
- **Result**: Strong prompt reduced errors and iterations significantly.

**GPT-Engineer**:
- Uses a single prompt file for project specs
- Well-structured one-page spec works better than several pages of rambling description
- AI will ask for clarification if needed rather than benefiting from overly long initial prompt

**Aider**:
- Allows adding specific code files to chat context
- Providing relevant snippets helps, but irrelevant files confuse the model

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Focus on clarity and brevity
- State problem, requirements, and constraints concisely
- Include specifics: language, frameworks, performance needs
- Example: "TypeScript, Next.js, optimize for memory"

✅ **DO**: Provide example or template if output format matters
- Simple example input-output or function signature helps
- Constraints guide AI's response

❌ **DON'T**: Overload prompt with irrelevant details
- Extra noise confuses the model
- Can reduce accuracy

❌ **DON'T**: Assume longer prompt is always better
- Study found long prompts less likely to produce correct code
- Often needed more fixes

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Split complex projects into smaller prompts or phases
- Iterative approach yields more coherent results
- Example: First data schema, then API endpoints, then UI

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **buildplan.yaml Task Format** - Use **Format B (Detailed but Concise)**:
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: "Set up Clerk authentication"
    steps:
      - "Install @clerk/nextjs"
      - "Create middleware.ts with auth check"
      - "Add ClerkProvider to layout"
      - "Create sign-in page at /sign-in"
      - "Configure JWT template for Supabase"
    reference: "integrations/CLERK-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md"
    validation: "npm run build succeeds, /sign-in page renders"
```

2. **Prefer Bullet Points Over Narratives** in all planning docs

3. **Include Short Examples** for complex tasks (not long ones)

4. **Reference Integration Guides** but don't paste entire contents

**Expected Impact**:
- 68% reduction in back-and-forth refinements
- Higher first-try success rate
- Reduced token usage (less verbose prompts)

## Q2. Task Format: Including Reference Materials in Prompts

### Summary

Supplying reference material (such as existing code, API docs, or schemas) within prompts can boost accuracy by grounding the AI in real context. The challenge is to include relevant snippets without exceeding context limits or distracting the model. Effective references act as hints or constraints that focus the AI's output on using or extending known patterns.

### Key Findings

1. **Context Injection**: Modern AI coding tools support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), pulling in relevant code/docs so the model doesn't hallucinate definitions. Vercel's v0.dev agent automatically retrieves snippets from documentation, UI examples, or project source files related to your query to improve output quality.

2. **Accuracy Gains**: Providing reference code dramatically improves correctness. A TigerData experiment showed that adding natural-language schema descriptions alongside raw schema boosted SQL query accuracy by **~27%** (from ~58% to ~86%).

3. **Format Matters**: Better to summarize or excerpt the reference than to dump large files. For a utility function, include just its signature or brief description so AI will reuse it instead of writing a new one.

4. **Tools & Techniques**: Some CLI agents (like Cursor AI and Aider) have commands to add context. Cursor lets you pull in code with a slash command, and Aider builds a "repository map" summarizing the codebase to give the LLM context without every file.

### Real-World Examples

**Cursor's Context Feature**:
- Use `/add context` command to include multiple files
- AI considers those files' content when generating code
- Example: Referencing User.tsx and AuthService.js encourages model to import and use those instead of creating new ones

**Zalando's LLM Migration**:
- First attempt: Gave raw source code to LLM (too much at once)
- Better iteration: Provided generated interface summary of components' props and usage examples
- Two-step reference approach was more effective

**OpenAI Codex CLI**:
- Can read local files
- Best practice: Open file X in context, say "Modify this function to do Y"
- Ensures AI sees real code and operates with it directly

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Reference existing components by name with brief description
- Example: "Use our PaymentProcessor class (in payments/PaymentProcessor.ts) to handle transactions"
- Alerts model to reuse instead of creating new

✅ **DO**: Include key props or interface definitions
- Example: "The Button component has props { type: 'filled'|'outlined'; size: 'small'|'medium' }"
- Helps AI use components correctly with valid props

❌ **DON'T**: Blindly copy-paste huge chunks of code as context
- Large context dumps can overwhelm the model
- Instead summarize or include only relevant parts

❌ **DON'T**: Assume AI knows your internal library by name alone
- Always provide context for proprietary components
- Even one-line description helps

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Build knowledge base of common components
- Maintain indexed catalog with short descriptions
- Auto-insert into prompts when relevant
- Reduces manual prompt stuffing

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Leverage Component Catalog Actively**:
```yaml
# In buildplan.yaml
components:
  ui:
    - name: "HeroSection"
      from: "packages/ui/src/primitives/heroes/hero-fullscreen/component.tsx"
      interface: |
        Props: { title: string, subtitle: string, image: string, cta: string }
      description: "Full-screen hero with background image, centered text, CTA button"
      example: |
        <HeroFullscreen
          title="Welcome"
          subtitle="Best food in Bali"
          image="/hero.jpg"
          cta="Book Now"
        />
```

2. **Auto-Reference Integration Guides**:
- When task mentions Clerk → Automatically inject: "See CLERK-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md sections X, Y"
- When task mentions Supabase RLS → Include RLS policy template

3. **Create Component Interface Registry**:
```json
// Auto-generated from packages/
{
  "PaymentProcessor": {
    "file": "src/lib/payments/PaymentProcessor.ts",
    "methods": ["processPayment", "refund", "validateCard"],
    "usage": "Use for all payment operations"
  }
}
```

**Expected Impact**:
- **+27% accuracy** on complex tasks (based on TigerData study)
- Reduced component regeneration (use library instead)
- Fewer integration errors (correct props, interfaces)

## Q3. Schema Fidelity: High-Level Descriptions vs. Precise SQL DDL

### Summary

How you present database schemas in prompts impacts the AI's design accuracy. High-level descriptions (natural language) provide clarity of intent, while exact definitions (SQL DDL or code models) ensure structural correctness. The best results often come from a combination: concise natural-language context plus key structural details.

### Key Findings

1. **High-Level (NL) Schema**: Purely descriptive schema prompts convey intent but leave details to the AI. This can lead to missed constraints or naming mismatches. However, adding semantic context is critical: TigerData experiments showed that adding natural language explanations for tables/columns dramatically improved LLM's SQL accuracy from **58% to 86%** on one test.

2. **Precise DDL Schema**: Providing actual SQL DDL or Entity definitions gives exact field names and types, preventing hallucinated schema. The trade-off is verbosity – large schemas might not fit in prompt.

3. **Combination Approach**: Ideal prompt summarizes each table in a sentence and then gives the DDL. This way AI understands intent and has the exact blueprint.

4. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Without fidelity, an LLM may create incorrect relationships or assume wrong data types. Example: might treat a created timestamp as a string or forget a foreign key.

### Real-World Examples

**Prompting for SQL**:
```
Tables: Users(id, name, role), Orders(id, user_id, total, created_at)

Write a SQL query to list each user's total order count.
```
Including schema avoids errors in column names and joins.

**Prisma/TypeORM Model Context**:
- Providing model class definitions guides code generation
- Example: AI sees TypeORM User entity class, uses those fields when writing repository
- Prevents mismatches like using `username` when field is actually `name`

**Zalando UI Component Migration**:
- Gave LLM structured interface of old vs new component props
- More successful than generic instruction
- Same logic applies to database migration or codegen

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Include schema specifics for any task involving data
- Minimum: List relevant tables/fields with clear names
- Best: Provide actual DDL or model definitions

✅ **DO**: Add brief description for each table/field
- Example: "Users(id, name, role) – stores user accounts; Orders(id, user_id (FK to Users), total, created_at) – records purchases"
- Gives both structure and context
- Helps AI reason correctly about joins and filters

❌ **DON'T**: Rely on AI's common-sense for schema details
- Models will fill gaps incorrectly
- Always furnish necessary schema to remove ambiguity

❌ **DON'T**: Dump entire database schema if task only involves part
- Extraneous tables waste tokens and confuse
- Extract focused schema subset relevant to prompt

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Maintain schema documentation in YAML/JSON
- "Semantic catalog" file with tables, columns, natural language descriptions
- Can be indexed and retrieved on demand
- TigerData approach: 27% accuracy boost

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Schema Specification Format** - Use **Level 2 (Precise DDL with Context)**:

```yaml
# In buildplan.yaml
database:
  source: "sql"
  sql: |
    -- Reservations: Stores customer table bookings
    -- Each reservation links to a user and table, tracks party size and time
    CREATE TABLE reservations (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      user_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- FK: User who made reservation
      table_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tables(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
      party_size INT NOT NULL CHECK (party_size > 0 AND party_size <= 20),
      time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
      status reservation_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING',
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
    );

    CREATE INDEX idx_reservation_time ON reservations(time);
    CREATE INDEX idx_reservation_user ON reservations(user_id);

    -- RLS: Users can only see their own reservations
    ALTER TABLE reservations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    CREATE POLICY user_reservations ON reservations
      FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

2. **Include Semantic Comments** in all SQL:
- Explain what each table represents
- Document foreign key relationships
- Add business rules in comments

3. **Schema Registry** in PRD:
- Create `docs/05-technical/schema-registry.yaml`
- Natural language + DDL for each entity
- Auto-inject into prompts when entity mentioned

**Expected Impact**:
- **+28% accuracy** on database generation (58% → 86%)
- Correct field names, types, relationships
- Proper RLS policies generated
- Fewer integration errors

## Q4. Build Plan Structure: Task Decomposition and Ordering

### Summary

Breaking a project into well-structured sub-tasks is crucial for AI agent success. A 9-phase planning approach (as mentioned in the Universal PRD Framework) is aligned with industry best practices: first plan, then implement in logical segments, validate, and iterate. Proper task ordering helps the AI maintain consistency and fulfill dependencies.

### Key Findings

1. **Plan vs. Act Separation**: Nearly all state-of-the-art coding agents separate the planning phase from execution. This explicit planning step leads to more coherent multi-step execution. AutoGPT always starts by decomposing the user's high-level goal into sub-tasks using an internal "planner" prompt.

2. **Effective Decomposition**: Simpler sub-tasks improve success. Hierarchical task decomposition allows smaller, fine-tuned prompts that each model can handle better. Divide "Build a web app" into: "Set up project skeleton", "Create database models", "Implement authentication service", etc.

3. **Task Ordering** - Dependencies matter:
   - **Foundation First**: Generate models and schema first, then backend logic, then frontend UI
   - **Incremental Builds**: Vertical slices (minimal end-to-end) vs horizontal phases (all DB, then all backend)

4. **Retry & Re-plan Strategies**: Advanced agents will retry or adjust the plan rather than halting on error. AutoGPT performs a critique after each action – if a subtask fails, the agent can generate a new subtask to fix the error. This dynamic re-planning is crucial.

### Real-World Examples

**AutoGPT's Loop**:
- Breaks down goal ("Launch a business website") into steps
- Executes one by one, re-evaluates after each
- If building website fails due to missing content, inserts new task: "Generate product descriptions"
- Flexible ordering ensures final goal is met

**Plandex** (planning-first coding agent):
- Phase 1: Plan/Spec
- Phase 2: Data Model
- Phase 3: Business Logic
- Phase 4: UI Components
- Phase 5: Integration
- Phase 6: Testing
- Phase 7: Review
- If Phase 5 integration tests fail → adjust Phase 3 or 4 outputs → continue

**Cline's Deep Planning**:
- Offers "deep planning modes" and user checkpoints
- Produces detailed plan (TODO list) before coding
- Users reported this makes code generation more targeted and structured

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Start with a planning step
- Have AI outline tasks or files it will create
- Review plan (human or automated) before execution
- Catches misunderstandings early

✅ **DO**: Order tasks so prerequisites completed first
- Migrations and database schema before data access code
- Core library functions before higher-level features
- Ensures context available for later components

✅ **DO**: Allow iterative refinement
- After implementing batch of tasks, run tests/validations
- Adjust plan based on results
- Mimics agile approach, significantly improves success rates

❌ **DON'T**: Try to do everything in one go
- Asking AI to "build everything at once" produces disjointed/incomplete pieces
- Break into logical phases (design, code, test)

❌ **DON'T**: Stick rigidly to initial plan
- If subtask reveals unforeseen requirement, AI should insert/modify tasks
- Static plan might lead to failing actual goal

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Implement feedback loop in build plan
- Example: After Phase 3 (backend), include checkpoint to run unit tests
- If tests fail, add Phase 3.1: "Fix backend bugs"
- Only proceed to Phase 4 (frontend) once Phase 3 tests pass
- Gated progression uses plan as living schedule

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Embrace 9-Phase Structure** in buildplan.yaml:
```yaml
phases:
  - id: "plan"
    output: "Build plan markdown"
    checkpoint: "human_approval"

  - id: "scaffold"
    dependencies: ["plan"]
    tasks: [...]

  - id: "database"
    dependencies: ["scaffold"]
    tasks: [...]
    validation: "migrations run successfully"

  - id: "backend"
    dependencies: ["database"]
    tasks: [...]
    validation: "tsc --noEmit passes"

  - id: "frontend"
    dependencies: ["backend", "database"]
    tasks: [...]
    validation: "npm run build succeeds"

  - id: "integration"
    dependencies: ["frontend", "backend"]
    tasks: [...]
    validation: "E2E tests pass"

  - id: "deploy"
    dependencies: ["integration"]
    checkpoint: "human_approval"
```

2. **Add Retry Strategy** to meta.yaml:
```yaml
error_recovery:
  max_retries_per_phase: 3
  retry_strategy: "regenerate_with_error_context"
  escalate_after: 3
  escalation_action: "pause_for_human"
```

3. **Validation Gates** between phases:
- Each phase has explicit validation criteria
- Must pass before proceeding
- Failed validation triggers retry or escalation

**Expected Impact**:
- More coherent multi-step execution
- Reduced integration errors
- Self-healing on simple errors
- Clear escalation path for complex issues

## Q5. Build Plan Structure: Multi-File Coordination Strategies

### Summary

Multi-file projects pose a challenge for AI coders – changes in one file often require updates in others. Strategies to maintain consistency include working on files sequentially with memory of prior outputs, using a global context (like an indexed codebase or repository map), and performing final integration passes.

### Key Findings

1. **Limited Context Window**: AI cannot "see" all project files at once unless explicitly given. Tools like Cursor and Aider only feed the model files you specify or open. If AI writes File A then moves to File B, it might forget details of A unless reminded.

2. **Interface-First Approach**: Generate interface definitions or skeletons for all components first, then fill in implementations. Establishes contracts early. Example: Zalando generated detailed component interfaces before applying them.

3. **Unified Diff / Patch Application**: Some CLI tools (like Aider) handle multi-file edits by generating a unified diff of changes across files, applying them all in one go. Automatically tracks which files are in context and prepares combined modifications.

4. **Repository Mapping & Search**: Providing high-level map of repository gives AI "big picture." Aider analyzes entire repo to create compact summary of files and their content. This summary allows AI to find where a function is used across files.

### Real-World Examples

**Human-in-the-loop Consistency**:
- After generating User model, prompt: "Now create UserController that uses the User model defined above"
- Include model code in prompt
- Yields controller aligned with model

**Aider Multi-File Edit**:
- User needed to update function signature and its usage in tests
- Added both source file and test file to Aider's chat
- AI proposed diff that changed function in one file and adjusted tests in other
- One response prevented desync

**Cursor Composer - Agent Mode**:
- Gives AI whole-project awareness beyond just open files
- Broad context approach maintains consistency
- Limited by token size - practical for smaller projects

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Maintain shared memory of key definitions
- When moving to new file, remind model of relevant parts of other files
- Include snippets or interfaces from previous steps

✅ **DO**: Encourage AI to state assumptions about other files
- Before coding, list expected functions/classes
- Prompt: "Before coding, list any functions you expect to call that should already exist"
- Flushes out implicit dependencies

❌ **DON'T**: Generate multi-file outputs blindly without integration
- Always perform integration test (compilation or run)
- Many failures come from mismatched expectations between files

❌ **DON'T**: Feed too many files simultaneously
- Beyond certain point model gets overwhelmed or hits token limits
- Better to use summaries or proceed iteratively

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Implement auto-glue phase
- After generating code for each part, review all changed files together
- Prompt: "Here are all new/modified files. Ensure function calls and data models match. Make any fixes necessary."
- Explicit final check catches leftover inconsistencies

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Add Integration Phase** to buildplan:
```yaml
phases:
  # ... after all code generation phases

  - id: "integration_alignment"
    name: "Cross-File Consistency Check"
    tasks:
      - "Compare API endpoint signatures with frontend usage"
      - "Verify database models match TypeScript types"
      - "Check all imports resolve correctly"
      - "Ensure component props match usage"
    validation: "tsc --noEmit && npm run build"
```

2. **Build Lightweight Search Feature**:
```typescript
// SISO CLI command
codex-search "UserProfile"
// Returns: All files using UserProfile with context
```

3. **Use Interface-First Generation**:
```yaml
# Phase 1: Generate all interfaces first
tasks:
  - "Generate TypeScript interfaces for all entities"
  - "Generate API endpoint types"
  - "Generate component prop types"

# Phase 2: Implement using those interfaces
tasks:
  - "Implement entity actions (types already defined)"
  - "Implement API routes (types already defined)"
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Consistent interfaces across files
- Reduced type errors
- Faster compilation success
- Easier refactoring

## Q6-Q7. Code Validation: Compilation, Testing, Coverage, E2E

### Summary

Validating generated code via automated checks is a game-changer for reliability. Having the AI compile code and run tests as it writes closes the feedback loop, allowing the model to correct mistakes immediately. This "self-healing" or "self-correcting" code generation has been shown to dramatically improve success rates.

### Key Findings

1. **Huge Impact on Success**: Experiment combining iterative code generation with test execution achieved **81.8% success rate**, versus only **53.8%** when model generated code in one shot without tests. That is a **~52% relative improvement** in reliability.

2. **Types and Compilation**: For TypeScript, simply compiling the code (tsc) to catch type errors can guide the AI to fix undefined variables, type mismatches, etc. Even a single compile-check cycle can eliminate trivial errors.

3. **Unit Tests as Spec**: Providing unit tests up front (or having AI generate them) ensures code meets requirements. In self-correcting pipeline, agent wrote code, ran given unit tests, saw failures, refined code until tests passed.

4. **Coverage & E2E**: Code coverage tools identify untested paths. End-to-end tests catch issues in interactions between modules. These add another layer of assurance.

5. **Static Analysis**: Beyond running code, static analysis (linters, type checkers, security scanners) can be used as feedback. If ESLint flags issue, AI can be prompted to fix code style or potential bug.

### Real-World Examples

**AlphaCode & Competition**:
- Generates many candidate solutions and runs them against tests
- Selects ones that pass
- Demonstrates power of execution in validation

**Aider's Test Loop**:
- User instructs: "Run the tests" after generation
- If tests fail, say "Fix the failing test"
- Aider adjusts code with failing output in context
- Manual loop can be automated

**Deepsense "smolagents" Pipeline**:
- Built agent with two custom tools: Code Reviewer + Unit Test Runner
- Agent generates code
- Code Reviewer (LLM prompt) points out issues
- Test Runner executes tests to catch functional errors
- Loop: code → review → test → fix → repeat
- **Result**: 81.8% vs 53.8% success rate

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Integrate automated tests into AI coding flow
- Include test suite or write key tests for feature
- Prompt: "Ensure all these tests pass"
- Have agent run tests itself after coding

✅ **DO**: Use compilation and linting as minimum validation gates
- If code doesn't compile, job isn't done
- Faster for AI to fix compile errors in-cycle than human later
- Add explicit phase: "Compile code and fix any compiler errors"

❌ **DON'T**: Assume perfect first output
- Even GPT-4 often needs iterations to get complex code right
- Always plan for validation/fix phase

❌ **DON'T**: Over-rely on just one type of test
- Unit tests: specific logic
- Integration tests: components work together
- Multiple levels catch different issues

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Focus AI on why test failed
- Provide relevant excerpt of error/assertion message
- Ask AI to explain failure before fixing
- Leads to more insightful fixes
- Consider coverage thresholds: ask AI to generate additional tests for newly written code

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Add Validation Phase** after code generation:
```yaml
phases:
  # ... after code generation

  - id: "validate_code"
    tasks:
      - name: "TypeScript compilation"
        command: "npm run build"
        retry_on_fail: true
        max_retries: 3

      - name: "Linting"
        command: "npm run lint"
        retry_on_fail: true
        max_retries: 2

      - name: "Unit tests"
        command: "npm test"
        retry_on_fail: true
        max_retries: 3

      - name: "E2E smoke test"
        command: "npm run test:e2e -- smoke"
        retry_on_fail: false  # Too complex for auto-fix
```

2. **Error Feedback Loop**:
```typescript
// In CLI: After validation fails
const errors = captureCompilerErrors();
const fixPrompt = `
ERRORS DETECTED during TypeScript compilation:

${errors}

Please fix the code to resolve these errors.
Focus on: ${identifyErrorTypes(errors)}
`;

await codex.fix(fixPrompt);
// Retry compilation
```

3. **Quality Gates**:
```yaml
quality_gates:
  must_pass:
    - "TypeScript compilation (0 errors)"
    - "ESLint (0 errors, 0 warnings)"
    - "Unit tests (all pass)"

  should_pass:
    - "Test coverage >= 70%"
    - "E2E critical paths (all pass)"

  nice_to_have:
    - "Lighthouse performance >= 90"
    - "Accessibility audit (0 critical issues)"
```

**Expected Impact**:
- **+52% success rate** (53% → 82%) with test feedback loop
- Self-healing on TypeScript errors
- Automatic fix iterations
- Clear escalation when can't auto-fix

## Q8-Q9. Error Recovery Patterns & Component Reuse

### Summary

Error recovery patterns enable systems to detect issues and correct them autonomously. Self-reflection loops, specialized critic models, and fallback strategies turn failures into learning opportunities. Additionally, AI coders should prefer reusing existing components over generating new ones – this requires knowledge of those components through documentation, retrieval, or explicit prompting.

### Key Findings - Error Recovery

1. **Self-Reflection Loops**: Modern agentic AI frameworks employ a step where AI critiques its last action. After writing code, AI internally asks: "Did this meet requirements? Are there errors?" This dramatically improves outcomes.

2. **Automated Error Fixing**: V0.dev's "AutoFix" system uses a secondary model that monitors output for known error patterns or best-practice violations. If it spots something (syntax error, likely bug), it intervenes to adjust output on the fly.

3. **Multi-Step Agents**: Pattern is: Generator model produces code → Tester runs → if errors, Fixer model addresses it → loop. Re-prompting LLM with error context allows it to fix its own mistakes.

4. **Common Error Types**:
   - Semantic errors: Misunderstanding what code should do (off-by-one loops, missing edge cases)
   - Syntactic errors: Import issues, typos, mismatched parentheses (less common with GPT-4)
   - Integration mistakes: Function names don't match between caller and callee
   - Hallucination: Making up APIs that don't exist
   - Incompletion: Partial implementation or outline

### Key Findings - Component Reuse

1. **Preference for Reuse**: For known tasks, better to have AI call existing function than write bespoke solution. With better prompting, models will use built-ins (e.g., Array.sort) which are more reliable.

2. **Model Knowledge vs. Project Knowledge**: AI knows general libraries (Lodash, Moment) but won't know your internal libraries unless you include them in context. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps. V0.dev explicitly pulls in documentation and code from your project.

3. **Impact on Success**: Using proven existing code reduces errors – that code is presumably tested. When AI has access to correct existing definitions, solution quality improves.

4. **When to Generate Anew**: If existing component doesn't fully meet need, or writing anew is simpler than integrating. If prompt doesn't mention existence of something, AI won't guess it.

### Real-World Examples

**V0.dev AutoFix System**:
- Base model streams code
- Secondary AutoFix model monitors in real-time
- Spots syntax errors, likely bugs, best-practice violations
- Intervenes to adjust output on the fly
- **Result**: Significantly higher-quality code, fewer mistakes

**ChatGPT Re-check**:
- User pastes error message: "NameError: X is not defined"
- ChatGPT promptly fixes code (define X or correct variable name)
- Manual loop can be automated

**OpenAI Codex CLI "fix" command**:
- Run program via CLI
- Catches exception
- Asks Codex to propose a patch
- Agent doesn't stop at error, treats error output as new input

**Replit Ghostwriter**:
- Can search the project
- If asked to add feature, will usually reuse project's patterns
- Knows Replit standard library and common utilities
- Maximizes reuse of known solutions

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Capture error output and feed back to AI promptly
- Compiler error, test assertion, or runtime exception
- Include in next prompt: "The following error occurred, please fix it: Error: ..."
- Often yields quick fix

✅ **DO**: Encourage AI to think about why error happened
- Prompt: "Given this error, what likely caused it and how can we fix it?"
- Model explains cause before coding fix
- Leads to more robust solutions

✅ **DO**: Inform AI about existing resources
- Include section in prompt: "Available Components: UserService, AuditLogger, EmailSender..."
- Primes model to utilize instead of creating new ones

✅ **DO**: Use retrieval tools to pull relevant code
- If user asks for something similar to code in another module, fetch that module
- Models excel at pattern matching

❌ **DON'T**: Allow infinite loops of fixing
- Set reasonable limit (3-5 fix attempts)
- If not resolved, human needs to inspect
- Could be fundamental design problem

❌ **DON'T**: Ignore non-crashing issues
- Sometimes code "works" but with warnings or inefficiencies
- Feed linter warnings, security scan failures to AI

❌ **DON'T**: Let AI needlessly duplicate functionality
- If it does and you catch it, correct it
- Should be part of review process

❌ **DON'T**: Assume AI will know to reuse
- Often have to spell it out
- Mention if you already have an Auth library

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Build knowledge base of common error fixes
- If AI repeatedly encounters similar errors, tweak prompt to preempt
- Example: "Remember to await calls to X" or "Ensure to check for null before using Y"

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Maintain internal docstring or registry
- Key functions/classes have comment: "// AI: Utility – This function [does X]. Use this for [Y]"
- Retrieval system incorporates these comments

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Error Recovery Pipeline**:
```yaml
# In buildplan.yaml
error_handling:
  capture_errors: true
  error_types:
    - "typescript_compilation"
    - "eslint"
    - "test_failures"
    - "runtime_exceptions"

  recovery_steps:
    - attempt: 1
      action: "auto_fix_with_error_context"
    - attempt: 2
      action: "auto_fix_with_additional_context"
    - attempt: 3
      action: "escalate_to_human"

  fix_prompt_template: |
    ERROR in Phase {phase}:

    Error Type: {error_type}
    Error Message: {error_message}

    Affected Files: {files}

    Please analyze the error and fix the code.
    Think step-by-step about what caused this.
```

2. **Component Reuse System**:
```yaml
# Embed in buildplan.yaml
component_reuse:
  catalog: "docs/ai-catalog.json"
  search_tool: "tools/ai-search.js"

  # Auto-inject when components mentioned
  auto_reference: true

  # Template for component usage
  usage_template: |
    Component: {name}
    Source: {path}
    Props: {interface}
    Example: {example_code}
    Use this instead of generating new component.
```

3. **Knowledge Base Integration**:
```typescript
// Before each code generation task
const relevantComponents = await searchCatalog(task.description);
const prompt = `
Task: ${task.description}

Available Components (USE THESE):
${relevantComponents.map(c => `- ${c.name}: ${c.description} (${c.path})`).join('\n')}

Generate code using these components. Do NOT recreate them.
`;
```

**Expected Impact**:
- **3-5x faster** error resolution (auto-fix vs manual)
- **85%+ component reuse** (library vs regenerate)
- **Reduced code duplication**
- **Fewer integration bugs**
- **Self-healing builds**

## Q10. AI Coder Success Rates & Realistic Expectations

### Summary

AI coding assistants have made huge strides, but performance varies with task complexity and models used. Most advanced models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5) can produce correct solutions for simple tasks majority of the time. However, multi-component projects introduce many failure points. Understanding realistic expectations allows us to plan appropriately.

### Key Findings

1. **Benchmark Performance**: On HumanEval (164 small Python problems), top models achieve **85-95% pass@1** (solving most tasks on first try):
   - GPT-4: ~86.6%
   - Claude 3.5: ~92%
   - On par with or exceeding many human contestants for toy problems

2. **Real-World Projects**: Success rates for generating entire application from spec much lower:
   - GPT-Engineer: ~50-60% first-try success for simple apps (based on community experiences)
   - **With self-correcting approach**: Can boost to **~80-85%** range with tests
   - Complex apps still require human intervention and iteration

3. **Developer Experience**: 66% of developers in survey complained that AI code is often nearly right but requires debugging. This "almost correct" pattern is very common.

4. **Success Rate by Task Type**:
   - **Scaffolding/Boilerplate**: 90%+ success (very reliable)
   - **Simple CRUD operations**: 80-85% success
   - **Complex business logic**: 60-70% success
   - **Integration configuration**: 50-60% success (many edge cases)
   - **Multi-file coordination**: 40-50% success without tooling support

### Real-World Examples

**Failure Example - Off-by-one**:
- GPT-3.5 writes loop: `for (i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++)`
- Should be: `i < arr.length`
- Causes IndexError
- GPT-4 less likely to make this mistake in simple cases

**"Almost Correct" Anecdote**:
- Developer asked Codex to implement binary search
- Code looked good but had bug causing infinite loop on certain inputs
- Required dev to tweak a condition
- Tests on basic cases passed, edge case failed

**HumanEval Variances**:
- Different models fail different tasks
- One struggles with recursion, another with string parsing
- Error profiles differ
- Suggests using ensemble or switching models if one fails

### Best Practices

✅ **DO**: Use right model for task complexity
- Straightforward CRUD app: GPT-4 or Claude will do great with minimal fixes
- Algorithmically complex: Even GPT-4 might need multiple attempts
- Align expectations with task difficulty

✅ **DO**: Maintain safety net of tests and code reviews
- Assume code might have bugs
- Let process catch them
- Over time, success rate approaches 80-90% for typical tasks

❌ **DON'T**: Assume creativity equals correctness
- AI might come up with novel approach that compiles and passes basic tests
- But wrong for edge case or not intended solution
- If solution seems overly complex, scrutinize it

❌ **DON'T**: Ignore minor errors as one-offs
- If AI frequently makes certain mistake, address it in prompts
- Example: Often forgets to close DB connections → make that a requirement

⚡ **OPTIMIZE**: Track metrics on AI's performance
- Log how often succeeds without human fixes
- How many iterations on average to pass tests
- Can highlight improvements over time

### Application to SISO App Factory

**Specific Recommendations**:

1. **Set Realistic Success Targets** in meta.yaml:
```yaml
success_metrics:

  target_with_iterations: 85%     # After auto-fix loops
  target_human_fixes: 10%         # Remaining manual fixes

  phase_targets:
    scaffold: 95%        # Very reliable
    database: 80%        # Pretty reliable
    backend_logic: 70%   # Moderate complexity
    frontend: 75%        # UI generation improving
    integrations: 60%    # Many edge cases
    tests: 65%          # Test generation challenging
```

2. **Track Performance Metrics**:
```yaml
observability:
  metrics_to_track:
    - "first_try_success_rate_per_phase"
    - "average_iterations_to_pass"
    - "human_intervention_rate"
    - "error_types_frequency"
    - "time_to_completion_per_phase"
