# BMAD Method Integration

This directory contains BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development) integration for structured domain planning and operation mapping.

## Structure

- `vendor/BMAD-METHOD/` - BMAD framework (auto-downloaded)
- `domain-flows/` - Domain-specific operation flows
- `templates/` - BMAD templates customized for this project
- `overview.md` - How BMAD is used in this project
- `db-plan-bmad.md` - Database planning with BMAD
- `mapping-page-ops.md` - Page-to-operation mapping

## Usage

1. Define domains in `src/domains/`
2. Map operations using BMAD workflows
3. Document flows in `domain-flows/`
4. Reference BMAD checklists for quality

## Resources

- [BMAD-METHOD GitHub](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)

# Master Planning Checklist

> Follow this checklist to complete all planning phases before implementation

## Phase 1: Industry Research ⏱️ Days 1-2
- [ ] Market size and trends analysis
- [ ] Consumer behavior patterns
- [ ] Payment and technology landscape
- [ ] Regional regulations and compliance
- [ ] Identify 10-15 competitor benchmarks
- [ ] Document findings in `docs/01-research/research-summary.md`

## Phase 2: Competitor Analysis ⏱️ Days 2-3
- [ ] Audit competitor websites/apps (features, UX, tech)
- [ ] Extract unique features and patterns
- [ ] Create feature comparison matrix
- [ ] Identify gaps and opportunities
- [ ] Document in `docs/03-features/feature-matrix.md`

## Phase 3: Feature Planning ⏱️ Days 3-4
- [ ] List all potential features (core + optional)
- [ ] Evidence-based prioritization (must-have, nice-to-have, future)
- [ ] Define MVP scope
- [ ] Map features to user journeys
- [ ] Document in `docs/03-features/features.md`

## Phase 4: Architecture Design ⏱️ Days 4-5
- [ ] Define domain boundaries (10-20 domains)
- [ ] Plan multi-tenancy strategy
- [ ] Select tech stack components
- [ ] Define security and compliance requirements
- [ ] Plan caching and performance strategy
- [ ] Document in `docs/05-technical/architecture.md`

## Phase 5: Page & Component Planning ⏱️ Days 5-6
- [ ] List all pages/routes
- [ ] Map pages to domains
- [ ] List components needed per page
- [ ] Identify shared components
- [ ] Plan component sourcing (21st.dev, shadcn, custom)
- [ ] Document in `docs/05-technical/component-catalog.md`

## Phase 6: Domain Operations (BMAD) ⏱️ Days 6-7
- [ ] Define operations per domain (CRUD + business logic)
- [ ] Map user workflows to operations
- [ ] Document operation sequences
- [ ] Create domain flow diagrams
- [ ] Document in `docs/00-methods/bmad/domain-flows/`

## Phase 7: Database Schema ⏱️ Days 7-8
- [ ] Design entity models (20-50 tables)
- [ ] Define relationships and constraints
- [ ] Plan multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Design indexes for performance
- [ ] Create ERD diagram
- [ ] Document in `docs/05-technical/schema-spec.md` and `erd.md`

## Phase 8: Build Planning ⏱️ Days 8-9
- [ ] Break implementation into phases (typically 7 phases)
- [ ] Decompose phases into tasks (100+ tasks)
- [ ] Define dependencies and ordering
- [ ] Estimate timeline (typically 12 weeks for MVP)
- [ ] Create domain-specific checklists
- [ ] Document in `docs/08-build-plan/master-checklist.md`

## Phase 9: PDR Creation ⏱️ Days 9-10
- [ ] Write Product Definition & Requirements
- [ ] Define business scope and KPIs
- [ ] Document tenancy and cost strategy
- [ ] List non-goals and future enhancements
- [ ] Create operational playbook
- [ ] Document in `docs/06-pdr/PDR.md`

## ✅ Planning Complete

When all phases are checked:
- [ ] Review all documentation for completeness
- [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] Archive planning artifacts
- [ ] Begin implementation using build plan

**Estimated Total**: 10 planning days + 12 weeks implementation = ~14 weeks to MVP
