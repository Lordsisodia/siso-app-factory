  - Break-even on bike asset ≈ 2.5 years with ~6.5M IDR annual revenue per 16.5M IDR bike.

  - Theft/damage mitigation via deposits, GPS, ID collateral.
  - Overheads: staff, storage, licensing, marketing.
- **Payments & Deposits**
  - Mix of cash, e-wallet (GoPay, OVO, DANA), QRIS, bank transfer; credit cards mainly via OTAs.

## 3. Competitive Landscape

- **Market Structure**
  - Highly fragmented; thousands of small operators.
  - Formal players: YourBestie (aggregator), Traveloka/tiket.com rentals, Bali Bike House (1,000+ fleet), Bikago, Cinchy, etc.
  - Informal street/guesthouse operators still significant.
- **Gig Partnerships**
  - Grab & Gojek operate rental/lease programs (including EV); third-party suppliers like Semilir support fleets.
- **Ride-Hailing vs Rentals**
  - Ride-hailing offers chauffeured mobility; rentals provide independence.
  - Regulatory restrictions on ride-hailing pickup in some areas favour rentals.
- **Success Factors**
  - Reliable/ diverse fleet, transparent pricing, insurance/security, partnerships (hotels, OTAs), 24/7 support, compliance, strong digital presence.
  - Failures: poor maintenance, vague contracts, no insurance, weak service quality.
