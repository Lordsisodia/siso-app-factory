## 1. Market & Business Model Insights

- **Key Pain Points (Tourists & Corporate Buyers)**
  - Fragmented information, difficult discovery of trustworthy guides, inconsistent quality, fear of scams/overpricing.
  - Limited itinerary personalization; tourists desire richer, “meaningful” experiences rather than templated tours.
  - Booking process is stressful: scattered channels, manual WhatsApp/email coordination, uneven payment options.
  - Corporate buyers face logistics complexity (transport, tickets, meals) spread across multiple vendors; lack consolidated invoicing, reporting, or one-stop procurement.
  - Tour operators cite fierce competition, poor differentiation, and low customer retention—creating space for curated platforms.

- **Competitive Landscape & Gap Analysis**
  - Dominant OTAs: Traveloka (Xperience), Tiket.com, Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia; specialist platforms like Klook, TripGuru.
  - Super-app tie-ins: Gojek’s Go-Travel with Tiket.com, Shopee x Traveloka for flights.
  - Gaps: bespoke guide matching, corporate-grade tour management, integrated quality assurance, and end-to-end concierge experiences remain underserved. Opportunity for “trusted guide marketplace + corporate portal.”

- **Tourism Market Size & Growth (2024–2025)**
  - 2024: ~13.74M international arrivals (+18% YoY); domestic trips ~1.02B (+22% YoY).
  - Foreign spend ~$16.7B (≈60% YoY jump). International visitors spend ≈USD1.2k per trip on average.
  - Online travel market ≈USD7.3B (2024) with ~9.8% CAGR projected to 2033; strong mobile-first adoption.
  - Traveler trends: >75% seek higher quality, culturally rich experiences; rising bleisure and slow-travel behaviors.

- **Customer Journey (Current-State)**
  1. Inspiration via TripAdvisor, social, blogs, OTA browsing.
  2. Comparison across OTAs/agency sites; often resort to direct WhatsApp with operators for tailored tours.
  3. Booking via OTA (for standard activities) or hotel concierge / local agency (cash/bank transfer).
  4. Execution with minimal real-time updates; limited digital navigation/tracking.
  5. Post-tour reviews ad-hoc; no systematic loyalty or service recovery mechanisms.
  - Corporate workflow: HR/admin solicits proposals from agencies/DMCs via email/phone; manual approvals, invoice chasing, and limited visibility.

- **Target Personas**
  - **Domestic Travelers**: large volume, mobile-native, Bahasa-first, value promotions and e-wallet payments; frequent weekend getaways.
  - **International Travelers**: expect English UI, credit card acceptance, pre-trip planning, safety assurances, flexible on-site add-ons.
  - **Corporate Clients**: need bulk booking tools, budget controls, reporting, licensed guides, and concierge-level support for MICE, team building, client hospitality.

## 2. Technical & Platform Architecture Considerations

- **Payments**
  - Must support GoPay, OVO, DANA, ShopeePay, QRIS, virtual accounts, credit/debit cards, PayLater options.
  - All domestic transactions denominated in IDR; partner with BI-licensed gateways (Midtrans, Xendit, Doku).
  - Provide invoicing and deferred payment flows for corporate clients.

- **Mapping & Location Services**
  - Primary: Google Maps/Places for routing, POI data, geocoding.
  - Supplement with offline-capable maps (OSM/Mapbox caching) for low-connectivity zones; allow handoff to Waze for traffic-aware routing.
  - Embed downloadable tour maps and meeting points; enable GPS-based progress tracking.

- **Connectivity & Offline Mode**
  - 4G coverage >90% nationally, yet remote attractions remain patchy—implement offline tour bundles (maps, audio, tickets).
  - Mirror critical alerts via SMS/email for redundancy; store guide/user contacts for direct fallback.

- **Distribution & Platform Form Factor**
  - Indonesia is decisively mobile-first; prioritize native apps (Android/iOS) with responsive web support (esp. corporate dashboards).
  - Offer deep-link integrations with super-apps (ride-hailing, payments) while remaining standalone.

- **Regulatory Compliance**
  - Register electronic system (PSE) with Kominfo; host privacy policy in Bahasa Indonesia + English.
  - Comply with Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL): consent, data subject rights, breach response, data minimization.
  - Enforce Rupiah pricing and use licensed PSPs per Bank Indonesia rules; support QRIS standard.
  - Incorporate locally and secure Tour & Travel Agency license (TDUP); onboard only licensed guides (HPI-certified) and verify documentation.

- **Real-Time Capabilities**
  - Live guide ETA, tour route progress, shareable safety tracking link, in-app messaging/voice.
  - Emergency assistance workflow (guide escalation, support hotline).

- **Content & POI Intelligence**
  - Curate historical/cultural storytelling, etiquette tips, safety advisories, “Instagrammable” photo spots, culinary/souvenir recommendations, environmental indicators.

- **Top Destination Priority List (MVP)**
  1. Bali (Ubud, Kuta/Seminyak, Uluwatu, Nusa Islands)

  3. Jakarta (city, culinary, cultural circuits)

  10. Batam/Bintan (short-haul from Singapore)
  - Expand to “Super Priority” destinations as government infrastructure matures.

- **Indoor / Complex Sites**
  - Provide annotated maps and step-by-step guidance for large complexes (Borobudur, museums) rather than full indoor positioning; integrate AR storytelling where feasible.
